## 📚 Academic Experience with Other Languages

During my studies at UnB, I've also had the opportunity to work with:

- **C**: Introduced in foundational programming courses.
- **C#**: Built a game in Unity during my first semester.
- **Java**: Applied in multiple academic projects, gaining a solid foundation in object-oriented programming.

While my primary focus is JavaScript and front-end development, these experiences have given me a broader understanding of software development principles.
